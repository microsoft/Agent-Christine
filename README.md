# Project

Purpose
The goal of Agent Christine is to help partners selling through the Microsoft Marketplace become self-sufficient in navigating the Azure Marketplace. By embedding expertise gained during the partner engagement into a virtual agent, partners can access timely support, resources, and guidance without needing ongoing direct assistance.
Benefits
- Empowers partners to independently manage onboarding, co-sell, transacting, and revenue reconciliation.
- Provides continuous access to curated deliverables, documentation, and best practices.
- Enhances partner confidence and accelerates marketplace adoption.
Agent Christine is built using Copilot Studio and integrates with a partner's resources they download from Partner Center. It can answer partner questions, surface relevant deliverables, and provide proactive alerts about upcoming milestones or missing documentation. This ensures partners have a reliable, intelligent assistant to guide them through their marketplace journey
