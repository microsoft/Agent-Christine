<p class=MsoNormal>What is included in this doc? This document contains
questions and answers related to Billing and Payouts topic</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
When will the partner be paid for their marketplace transaction?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>Answer: Payment schedule will primarily
depend on two key factors: the type of agreement the customer is on (i.e. EA or
non-EA) and whether the purchase is subscription based or usage based. For
subscription-based, purchases from EA customers are paid out to partners in the
subsequent month following the purchase, regardless of whether the customer has
paid yet or not. Payments on non-EA customer purchases are dependent on
customer collection, and are paid out to partners in the subsequent month
following the customer payment to Microsoft. For example, if a non-EA customer
makes a purchase in Month 1, it will get invoiced in Month 2, and if customer
pays the invoice in Month 3, then partner gets paid in Month 4. However, if
customer pays invoice early (before due date) in Month 2, then partner will be
paid in Month 3. For usage based purchases, an extra month is added for payment
on EA customer transactions, whereby Microsoft consolidates all previous month
usage in the month after the consumption event, and then pays out the partner
in the month thereafter. There is no payout schedule impact on usage based
transactions by non-EA customers. Customers are still invoiced in Month 2 on
previous month usage, and partner will be paid in the subsequent month
following the customer payment to Microsoft. Please refer to this article for
further details on how payout schedules work in Marketplace: <a

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
How can I tell if the customer is on EA or non-EA agreement?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Answer: There are multiple ways to check whether
a customer is on an EA or non-EA agreement. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In Partner Center Insights Revenue report, Sales Channel field
will say Enterprise for EA customers. All other sales channels are non-EA</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The customer billing account ID used in the Private Offer will be
7 or 8 digits if the customer is on an EA agreement. If this billing account ID
shows a long string of numbers and letters, the customer is on a non-EA agreement</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In the Earnings Report, if the related invoice number starts with
an E then this is an EA customer. If the invoice number starts with a G this is
a non-EA customer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
Why is there a discrepancy between what the partner was paid and what the
transaction amount was</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:.25in'>Answer: There
can be multiple factors why a partner’s payout does not match the transaction
amount. When not accounting for the marketplace agency fee that gets deducted
from the payout, the most common reason will be due to foreign currency
exchange rates. Microsoft Treasury uses a monthly exchange rate at the month of
customer purchase to translate the customer’s local currency payment to the
partner’s designated payout currency. The offer price is translated using a
monthly exchange rate at the month the private offer is first saved in Partner
Center. Due to these different exchange rates being used, there could be a
difference in what the partner is expecting to receive on the purchase and what
they actually receive. For more details on how currency conversion works in the
Marketplace, please refer here: <a

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
Who can the partner ask for advice or consult on bank changes or account
changes due to payment issues?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Answer: Microsoft cannot provide
consultation or guidance, but if the partner’s bank is no longer going to
support payments, they should consider other options.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:</b>
<b>What if the partner’s currency is not being accepted by Microsoft’s banks?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Answer: Partner may update their
payment instrument to PayPal and/or change their currency in their Partner
Center Payment Profile. Once the Payment Profile is updated, we can attempt
another payment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
Why is the &quot;estimated monthly payout&quot; not exactly accurate  (i.e.
shows payment to be received in two months when it should be next month)?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Answer: The Estimated Payment Month
in Partner Center is a standard estimated time frame that is set in the UI in a
way that best accommodates multiple marketplace programs. As such, it may not
accurately reflect the actual payment month, depending on the program at hand.
For example, if your program pays out transactions in the month directly
following those transactions, then the unprocessed balance will be paid sooner
than what is shown in the UI (e.g. July transactions to be paid in August).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
Where do customers go if they have questions on their invoice? </b>Answer: Customers
with questions/issues on billing and invoicing will need to open a support ticket
in Azure Portal. This ticket will then be routed to the appropriate Invoice
Support team for assistance. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
The dates shown on the customer invoice do not match the actual subscription
dates from the private offer, what is the process to get the invoice dates
amended? </b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Answer: There is not a way to retroactively
amend invoice dates. The Microsoft invoice is system generated based on the actual
purchase date and term duration selected on the platform. Note that these dates
may differ from the corresponding subscription start/end dates as outlined and
agreed upon within the partner contracts signed by the customer within the
Azure Portal platform private offer experience. Customers should work directly
with the partner to gain supporting documentation on actual contract dates as
needed for reconciliation purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Question:
How does the customer refund process work?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Answer: Refunds are systematically
processed if customer cancels within a 72 hour window from the time of
purchase. If outside this 72 hour window, customer must create a support ticket
directly in Azure Portal to request a refund or work with the partner to create
the support ticket on their behalf. For customers on Non-EA agreements, all
refunds are issued via line-item adjustments on their invoice, with a revised
invoice being issued if previously sent. For customers on EA agreements, all
refunds are issued via Credit Memos, whereby customer must use the Credit Memo
to apply against the unpaid invoice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>10.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Question: My customer
needed a credit for an Azure Marketplace service. We aren't able to see their
credit in the EA portal. When will it be visible?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>Answer: Credits for Azure Marketplace and
Azure Charges Billed Separately cannot be provided in the Azure portal due to a
systems limitation. They can only be provided via a credit memo. These credits
are not visible in the Azure portal or in Explore.ms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>11.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Question: Who will the
Marketplace credit memo be sent to?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Answer: The credit memo will be
sent to the Bill To contact on the enrollment. For Direct enrollments this will
be to the customer. For Indirect enrollments this will be the customer's
partner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>12.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Question: The customer
received a credit memo. How do they use it?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Answer: The customer or partner can reach
out to their local Global Financial Services Credit and Collections team to
apply the credit memo.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>13.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></b><b>Question: Why can't the
customer get their credit in the Azure portal?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Answer: Due to a system limitation in the
Azure portal Microsoft is unable to process Microsoft credits in the Azure
portal. Engineering is working on a solution to this issue.</p>
