<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Access Azure Portal &#8594; Marketplace<br>
     Navigate to the Azure Portal, then search for <i>Marketplace</i> &#8594; <i>Private
     Offer Management</i>. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Locate the Private Offer<br>
     Use filters (offer name, publisher, preparer, status) to find the specific
     offer. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Review Offer Details<br>
     Before accepting, verify:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Legal entity for which the offer is made </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Plans included and features </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Private Offer price </li>

  <li class=MsoNormal>Offer validity dates (start / end) and expiration of
      acceptance itself. </li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Accept the Offer<br>
     When satisfied with terms, click View + Accept &#8594; accept. After
     acceptance, status will show as <i>Accepted – Pending Purchase</i>. It may
     take ~15-60 minutes before the offer becomes purchasable. </li>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Step 3: Purchase / Subscribe to the Private Offer </b>- <a

<p class=MsoNormal>After the offer is accepted and available for purchase,
here’s what happens:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Verify directory / tenant<br>
     Ensure you are in the correct Azure tenant (directory) that holds the
     billing account for the offer. If you just accepted, you likely already
     are. If not, switch directories. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Check offer status &amp; dates</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The offer must be in <i>Accepted</i> (or <i>Term Ending</i>)
      status.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Current date should fall between the offer’s start and
      end dates. The offer end date determines when it can be purchased, not
      how long the subscription lasts. Billing term/plan defines subscription
      duration. </li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Confirm user permissions<br>

 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Subscription / plan details (for SaaS, etc.)</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>For SaaS, specify number of users, billing term, whether
      to auto renew. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>After subscribing, activate the SaaS product via the

 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Other product types<br>
     Depending on what the Private Offer contains, steps differ slightly:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Professional services: may allow creating a new Azure
      subscription or use an existing one. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Virtual Machines (VM) products: For VM products, the
      purchase flows through the VM create wizard or reservation interface. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Virtual Machine Software Reservations (VMSR): special
      roles needed, ensure correct plan. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Azure apps / managed apps: typical resource creation
      steps follow purchase. </li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Finalization &amp; activation</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Make sure you configure any vendor-specific activation

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Marketplace Purchase FAQ from Private Offer Deal shiproom
review in FY25</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Question 1:  How can customer re-trigger a new invoice for a
transaction moved from incorrect to correct billing profile?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Cancel old purchase, request refund, then accept
&amp; purchase new private offer with correct billing profile. Update stacked
private offer dates for yrs 2 &amp; 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Question 2: How to tag different PO numbers in the same
private offer for purchase?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: 1 private offer currently can only tag one PO
number, so need the seller to create 2 private offers splitting the deal and
buyers can attach PO for each private offer purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Question 3: Will stacked private offers migrate together
from EA to MCA? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Yes these private offers will migrate together
automatically as long as they are on auto-renew</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Question 4: If the partner is having a 50% reduction of
agency fee on the private offer, what would be their end date for the reduced
fee? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: it will be the end of the subscription date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Common top issues when purchasing private offers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 1.</b> why I can't find the private offer in the
Private Offer Management dashboard?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer:  There are multiple steps to check. Firstly, To view
private offers in the private offer billing account, please check if you are
the subscription owner, contributor or reader. Additionally for MCA account
users, please check if you are the billing account owner, contributor or
reader’s role. For EA account users, please check if you are the enterprise
administrator. For details on role requirements for purchasing private offers,
see&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/roles-permissions">Roles
and Permissions</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please also confirm your billing account id with your seller
to make sure the private offer is created under the correct billing account. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Make sure your billing account ID aligns
to the Azure subscription you wish to use for subscribing. Find your billing
account ID from the Azure subscription properties. For details on getting your
billing account details, see&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/private-offers-pre-check#locate-your-billing-account-id">How
to locate your billing account ID</a>. For guidance on switching directories,
see&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/set-preferences#switch-and-manage-directories">Switch
and manage directories</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 2:</b> Why I can’t accept a private offer?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: you need to have one of the following roles in the
billing account of the private offer:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>For MCA, the billing account owner and contributor</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>For EA, the EA administrator</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>For details, see&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/roles-permissions">Roles
and Permissions</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 3:</b> I can view the private offer
in&nbsp;Private Offer Management, and the status is&nbsp;Accepted, but I can't
see the purchase button, what should I do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: The Purchase button is only available once the
private offer start date is current or in past. Hence please check the&nbsp;<b>Product
status</b>&nbsp;date, if the date is in future, the purchase button will not be
shown until the date is current. Check back on or after the&nbsp;<b>Start date</b>.
If the start date is upon acceptance, the product will take an hour before they
are ready for purchase.<br>
<br>
When these products are ready to be purchased, the private offer status changes
to&#8239;Accepted, and the product status changes to&#8239;Ready. You also
receive an email letting you know that your products are ready for purchase.<br>
<br>
Keep checking back and refresh. If the status remains
in&#8239;Pending&#8239;for more than 60 minutes, contact support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 4: </b>I can see the purchase button, but when I
try to subscribe, I get an error message, what should I do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: You must have an eligible Azure subscription
available under the private offer billing account.&nbsp; Sponsored and free
Azure subscriptions aren't eligible for marketplace purchasing. If no Azure
subscriptions are available, subscription and billing administrators can create
a new Azure subscription under the billing account for which the private offer
was created. Once complete, ensure that you have the required subscription
administration role, then retry. Here are links to follow <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription">How
to create a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) subscription</a>&nbsp;and <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-enterprise-subscription">How
to create a subscription for an Enterprise Agreement (EA)</a>. Also please
check if more than 100 subscriptions are available under the private offer
billing account.<span style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:#161616;background:white'> </span>Use the global
subscription filter to select only the desired subscription, then retry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 5:</b> I can view the private offer in Private
Offer Management, and the View + accept button is blue, but the status is
Pending, and the Purchase button is grayed out or disabled</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Check for a blue View + accept button for the
private offer in Private Offer Management. A blue&nbsp;<b>View + accept</b>&nbsp;button
signals that the private offer isn't accepted yet. Accept the private offer,
then retry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 6: </b>The&nbsp;Purchase&nbsp;button is still
blue or active, but I already subscribed. Does it mean my purchase isn't
complete?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: SaaS products in a private offer can be purchased
more than once. Check if your initial purchase is complete. For SaaS products,
you can confirm if your purchase is complete by finding the SaaS resource you
created when subscribing and checking its&nbsp;<b>Product and Plan details</b>.
If your purchase is completed, you see this message:&nbsp;<b>Your subscription
was configured successfully.</b>&nbsp;You can also check to see other SaaS
billing details. If your purchase isn't completed, you see this message:&nbsp;<b>Configure
your account on the publisher’s website</b>&nbsp;accompanied by a&nbsp;<b>Configure
account now</b>&nbsp;button. For Azure Apps, Containers, VMSRs, and Professional
services private offers can only be purchased once. If the purchase button is
blue/active, the subscribe step isn't complete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 7:</b> I can select Subscribe, but it fails, and
I get an error: Enrollment for Azure Marketplace is set to Free/BYOL SKUs only
or Marketplace is not enabled for the Azure subscription, what should I do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Check if Allow Azure Marketplace Purchases policy is
disabled for paid offers. Work with your billing administrator to turn on
the&nbsp;<b>Allow Azure Marketplace Purchases</b>&nbsp;policy, then retry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 8:</b> Do I have to configure my account? If I
can’t complete it now, what should I do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: You must complete the Configure your account step
which includes registering your purchase on the vendor’s website. Once you
complete this step, your seller is responsible for confirming your purchase
with Microsoft within 30-days of subscribing. If you can’t complete this step
now, you will have 30 days to troubleshoot and complete the step. If you
believe that you already completed this step and successfully registered your
purchase on the vendor’s website, but you're still prompted to configure your
account in SaaS management, contact your seller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 9: </b>I subscribed to the product successfully
for a SaaS private offer, but the Configure your account button is grayed-out
or inactive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Make sure you're either the subscription owner or
contributor for the Azure subscription used for the private offer purchase and
then retry. For more information on private offer role requirements, see&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/roles-permissions">Roles
and Permissions</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 10:</b> I can subscribe a SaaS private offer successfully,
and when I select Configure your account, Microsoft Entra requests permissions
before I can proceed, and I can’t accept the request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: For SaaS marketplace purchases, configuring your
account requires Microsoft Entra permissions for single sign-on to your ISV
vendor’s website. This step is required to complete the purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your organization's Microsoft Entra settings don't allow
user consent for apps, you see a dialog box stating Need admin approval. Work
with a global administrator in your organization to grant admin consent for
your ISV vendor’s Microsoft Entra app. Once consent is granted, retry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your organization's Microsoft Entra settings allow
approval with admin consent, you see a dialog box stating Approval required.
You can request admin consent directly from a global administrator or
designated reviewer. Once consent is granted, retry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your organization's Microsoft Entra settings allow user
consent, you see a dialog box stating Permissions requested. You can select
Accept to proceed to the ISV vendor’s website. We recommend that you do it only
for Microsoft Entra apps that publish by a verified publisher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 11:</b> I can subscribe successfully, select
Configure your account, and permission Microsoft Entra single sign-on, but I
see an error on the vendor's website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Your vendor's website might present an error in
their domain, for example a&nbsp;<b>500 Internal Server Error</b>. Work with
your vendor to validate that their marketplace registration flow is functional,
then retry the&nbsp;<b>Configure your account</b>&nbsp;step to complete the
purchase. Also check with your network administrator to see if your network
settings allow you to access the vendor’s marketplace registration page.<span
style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;
color:#161616'> </span>Your network might present an error in your domain
stating that access to the external domain is blocked. Work with your network
administrator to allowlist the domain of the vendor's marketplace registration
page, then retry. If necessary, you can request the marketplace registration
page URL from the vendor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 12:</b> How can I get support to help me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: If you don't find what you need in this
troubleshooting guide or need more help, you can get support by&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/get-support#get-support-from-the-azure-portal">creating

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 13:</b> What are the key differences for
purchasing private plans compared to private offers?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some scenarios, your organization might purchase using a
private plan. Like private offers, private plans also enable negotiated
deal-making but don't support some important private offer capabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Key private plan experience differences include:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Targeting</b>: Private plans use Tenant ID instead of
     Billing Account to align to specific customers.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Acceptance</b>: Private plans don't use the private
     offer acceptance experience but share the same subscribe and purchase
     experience as private offers.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Role requirements</b>: Billing owner and administrator
     roles aren't required to purchase; only the subscription owner or
     contributor role is required.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Offer types</b>: Private plans don't support virtual
     machine software reservations (VMSR) or professional offer types.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel selling models</b>: Multi-party and Cloud
     Solution Provider (CSP) private offers aren't supported.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Management</b>: Private offer management and Purchase
     Order tagging aren't supported.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, private offers provide more deal-making
capabilities and are built to ensure alignment between customer procurement and
IT teams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 14:</b> How to find private plans in the Azure
portal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: If you're eligible for private plans, in the Azure
portal, select&nbsp;<b>+ Create a resource</b>&nbsp;or search for
&quot;marketplace&quot; to go to the&nbsp;<b>Marketplace</b>&nbsp;page. You see
the&nbsp;<b>You have private products available</b>&nbsp;banner on the top of
the page. Select&nbsp;<b>View private plans</b>&nbsp;to go to your private
plans page. You can see the available private plans under the&nbsp;<b>Plans</b>&nbsp;tab,
marked with a distinctive&nbsp;<b>Private</b>&nbsp;badge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Question 15: </b>How to Find a private plan in AppSource?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: It can take up to 48 hours (about two days) after
the ISV publishes the new private plan before you see it in AppSource. To find
private plans associated with your tenant ID, select&nbsp;<b>Private plans</b>&nbsp;(lock
icon) at the upper right of AppSource.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you aren't signed in, a message prompts you to do so. You
can then purchase the private plans associated with your tenant ID on the&nbsp;<b>Plans
+ pricing</b>&nbsp;tab.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Question 16: If I can’t find any private plans that I expect
to see, what should I do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Answer: Ensure that the tenant to which you're signed-in
aligns to the tenant ID that you provided your vendor.&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant">How
to find your Microsoft Entra tenant ID</a>. For VMs use the&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id">Azure
Subscription ID.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Check with your vendor to ensure that the private plan they
created is using the tenant ID that you shared. Your vendor must add your
tenant ID to the plan's private audience list and not remove it unless you
unsubscribe. Removing the tenant ID from the plan could prevent correct billing
if you're using a plan that supports metered billing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ensure that you're not buying through a Cloud Solution
Provider (CSP). Private plans aren't available on a CSP-managed subscription.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ensure that Marketplace is enabled in your billing account
-&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/ea-azure-marketplace">Azure
Marketplace</a>&nbsp;– if it isn't, you must contact your billing administrator
to enable marketplace, for more information regarding Azure Marketplace,
see&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/ea-azure-marketplace">Azure
Marketplace</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Check if private marketplace is enabled for the tenant used
in your private plan. If it is, your private marketplace administrator must
activate the&nbsp;<a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/create-manage-private-azure-marketplace-new#collection-rules">Enable
private products collection rule.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the private plan is visible, and the deployment fails,
ensure that your billing administrator enabled marketplace purchases by
following the instructions at&nbsp;<a

 <li class=MsoNormal>Delay between Accept + Purchase: After accepting, there
     can be a wait (~15-60 min) before purchase is enabled. Immediate purchase.
     </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Permissions mismatch: Sometimes the person who accepts the
     offer is not the same as who purchases. Make sure correct roles are
     assigned.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Offer expiration: Even if you accept, there is often an
     expiry date for when the offer must be accepted, and separately, a date
     after which you cannot purchase. Don’t wait too long.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Renewal pricing: If the private offer ends before your
     billing term ends, renewal may revert to public pricing unless replaced by
     another private offer. Understand auto renew settings. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Vendor activation steps: For SaaS products especially,
     extra steps on vendor’s side (authentication via Entra / SSO,
     registration) may block full access until completed.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Network or policy blocks: Entra app consent, network
     domain allow-listing for vendor sites, etc., might obstruct activation.
     Identify these early.</li>
</ul>
